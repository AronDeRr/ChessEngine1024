# ChessEngine1024

 I will be creating a small chess engine following the rules of [Sebastian Lague's Tiny Chess Bots Challenge](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge). This engine is made after the challenge has already completed, but I wanted to see what I can make. This is my first time writing code in C#.
